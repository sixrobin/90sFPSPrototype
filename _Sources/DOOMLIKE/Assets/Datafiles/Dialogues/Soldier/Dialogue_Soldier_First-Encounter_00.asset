  - _text: Made it out alive, uh ? Seems you're a tough guy.
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: What are you looking for anyway ? Finding answers ? Trying to save us
      all ?
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: Guess you wanna go through that big door, right ? You might find what
      you want behind, but if I were you...
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: I'd turn around. That's the best thing you can do if you want to stay
      alive.

  - _text: You're going on, don't you ? Aight man, but don't say I didn't warn you
      once you're dead.
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: That gate can't open just like this, there are 4 energy cells you need
      to destroy to break the security system.
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: Yeah I know, that seems too much for one gate, but believe me, it's better
      like that for everyone !
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: Anyway... the gate won't be useful much longer so... I won't stop you.
      Maybe you can do something, save us ? Ah ah ! Ah...
    _clip: {fileID: 0}
  - _text: I'll open the door to the first energy cell. Do not thank me. No no, you
      really should not.
